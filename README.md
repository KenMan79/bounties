# rfp-specs
Requests For Proposals (RFP) for projects building on and supporting NEAR.

*This is a work in progress so bear with us :)*

## Overview

To help the community better participate in the creation of everything from core infrastructure to design sprints, this repo is designed to surface the key needs the NEAR Project has discovered.

Over time, we will better clarify the procedure for defining specs, working on specs, and receiving grants or rewards for delivering on them.


### How to get involved

This is a work in progress!  If you see a spec or RFP pop up here, drop a comment on it or reach out to the maintainer.


### Grants or rewards

Every RFP or spec will be different. Many may not list specific rewards, particularly as we are figuring this out.  Your best path forward is to contact the producer of the spec or comment directly on it so they can engage with you.
