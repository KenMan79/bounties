# rfp
Requests For Proposals (RFP) for projects building on and supporting NEAR.

*This is a work in progress so bear with us :)*

## Overview: Calling Developers, Designers, Product People and Founders!

To help the community better participate in the creation of everything from core infrastructure to design sprints, this repo is designed to surface the key needs the NEAR Project has discovered.  It is the basic precursor to future Grants Program activities and it is intended to help anyone clearly and transparently participate in meaningful projects that support NEAR.


**These specs are emphatically both technical and non-technical in nature**

Over time, we will better clarify the procedure for defining specs, working on specs, and receiving grants or rewards for delivering on them.


### How to get involved

This is a work in progress!  If you see a spec or RFP pop up here, drop a comment on it or reach out to the maintainer.


### Grants, bounties or rewards

Every RFP or spec will be different. Many may not list specific rewards, particularly as we are figuring this out.  Your best path forward is to contact the producer of the spec or comment directly on it so they can engage with you and figure out what will make it worth it.

As always, eligibility requirements will vary for grants and rewards so it's also important to check in on that.


## Examples

Some examples of potential RFP projects might include large and small, technical and non-technical projects:

1. Another NEAR client implementation, for example in Go
2. A third party wallet integration
3. A user research survey of projects and founders across the ecosystem
4. A design for a sample delegation interface in a wallet
4. A rapid prototyping framework which shows how NEAR is different from other UX flows


## FAQ
### How is building for an RFP/spec different from addressing a code issue?

If you are a developer, you can get involved directly with the main repos by going directly to those and checking out the open issues.  The RFP/specs in this repo are intended to involve larger projects which will likely have their own repos (if code-oriented) or which will likely be otherwise totally separate from any of the existing repos.


## Helpful Links

1. The main [Contributor Program page](https://near.org/contributor) where you can participate in a wide range of community-focused activities (usually these are more bite-sized than projects in this repo)
2. The [Community coordination repo](https://github.com/near/community) where community activities are actually coordinated.
3. The [Events Repo](https://github.com/nearprotocol/near-events) where events that team members might sponsor, speak at or host are submitted and tracked
3. Any of the repos in the [NEAR Github](https://github.com/near) will have READMEs listing their contribution process


## TODO

1. Create an issue template to make it easier for people to submit RFPs, categorize them and otherwise interface with this repo
2. Create a Trello board or other project tracking device which better exposes the actual progress of these specs/rfps.
3. Clarify the way to onboard with a new RFP
3. Clarify to RFP producers how exactly they should put together an RFP
3. Clarify the grant/reward process associated with them
4. Make sure everything everywhere links to this -- Contributor Program, website, blog posts, etc as a tangible set of ways to get involved.
