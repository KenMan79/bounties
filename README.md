# rfp-specs
Requests For Proposals (RFP) for projects building on and supporting NEAR.

*This is a work in progress so bear with us :)*

## Overview

To help the community better participate in the creation of everything from core infrastructure to design sprints, this repo is designed to surface the key needs the NEAR Project has discovered.

Over time, we will better clarify the procedure for defining specs, working on specs, and receiving grants or rewards for delivering on them.


### How to get involved

This is a work in progress!  If you see a spec or RFP pop up here, drop a comment on it or reach out to the maintainer.


### Grants or rewards

Every RFP or spec will be different. Many may not list specific rewards, particularly as we are figuring this out.  Your best path forward is to contact the producer of the spec or comment directly on it so they can engage with you.

## FAQ
### How is this different from code issues?

If you are a developer, you can get involved directly with the main repos by going directly to those and checking out the open issues.  This is intended to involve larger projects which will likely have their own repos (if code-oriented) or which will likely be otherwise totally separate from any of the existing repos.


## TODO

1. Create an issue template to make it easier for people to submit RFPs, categorize them and otherwise interface with this repo
2. Create a Trello board or other project tracking device which better exposes the actual progress of these specs/rfps.
3. Clarify the way to onboard with a new RFP
3. Clarify to RFP producers how exactly they should put together an RFP
3. Clarify the grant/reward process associated with them
4. Make sure everything everywhere links to this -- Contributor Program, website, blog posts, etc as a tangible set of ways to get involved.
